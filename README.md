SimpleTableSearch
=================

A very simple jquery plugin to search a table. 

Instructions:
Add a text box and give it a class of "search-table-textbox" and a data-tableid for the id of the table you want to search.
If you want to have a td in the table not be searchable, just add a class of no-search to that td and it won't be searched.

That should be it!
